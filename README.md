# Maurer-Roses
Maurere Roses is a generative art project using p5.js to create dynamic visualizations of spheres based on Maurer Rose geometry. The code generates intricate, rotating shapes that grow, shrink, and morph, with both predefined and randomly generated roses appearing in an endless loop.
